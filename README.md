# Code for Multiple Convergent Cross Mapping

This repo contains code for the Multiple Convergent Cross Mapping analysis as demonstrated in the 2020 HCI Journal publication [Modeling interaction as a complex system](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07370024.2020.1715221).

Code is offered in R (Analysis_Parallel_Multiple.Rmd), which can be run on the small example dataset (example_data.csv) to calculate the causal relationship between e.g. battery level and session count for a handful of smartwatch users.

Please note, an (empty) folder called 'images' needs to be present in your project's root directory for the code to run successfully.
